# SSVEP-Detection-with-Autoregressive-Models
Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) are electrical signals elicited by intermittent luminous stimulation, characterized by a specific frequency of blinking. Our research is centered around employing autoregressive methods for signal estimation, with a primary emphasis on the Autoregressive (AR) approach.

## Project Overview:
Our efforts aim to analyze SSVEP signals within a given time window, unraveling the frequency characteristics associated with the visual stimuli. The primary focus is on utilizing autoregressive methods to gain insights into the underlying temporal dynamics.

## Key Features:
Frequency-Specific Analysis: Employing AR methods to identify and characterize the frequencies stimulated during luminous events.

Time-Window Estimation: Analyzing SSVEP signals within predefined time windows to capture temporal variations.

## Methodology:
The Autoregressive (AR) approach is our chosen method for estimation. By leveraging autoregressive modeling, we aim to capture the complex dynamics inherent in SSVEP signals, providing a detailed understanding of the stimulated frequencies.
